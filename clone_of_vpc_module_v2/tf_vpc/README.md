This is a copy of Turnbull's tf_vpc module copied from Github.

It wouldn't terraform init because he needs splat syntax in one place.  Easy fix but I had to copy
 and modify his repo to do the fix.  Original source of this code is:

https://github.com/turnbullpress/tf_vpc/tree/v0.0.2

Note that it is version v0.0.2
